## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (either locally or using a service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-chat-application.git

Navigate to the backend directory:

        cd real-time-chat-application/backend

Install backend dependencies:

npm install

Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following:


MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/chat-app
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=5000

Replace mongodb://localhost:27017/chat-app with your actual MongoDB connection string if using a cloud service.
Set a strong secret for JWT tokens.

Start the backend server:

node server.js

Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd ../frontend

Install frontend dependencies:

npm install

Start the React application:

npm start

Your application should now be running on http://localhost:3000 for the frontend, and the backend should be reachable at http://localhost:5000.

How to Use

Go to the application in your web browser.
Register a new account or log in with an existing account.
Enter a chat room name and start chatting!
You can change rooms anytime by entering a new room name.
